Education
======
* Ph.D in Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Urban Design and Planning , University of Wahsington, 2029 (expected)
* Master in Urban Planning, Zhejiang University, 2025
* B.Eng. in Urban and Rural Planning, Zhejiang University, 2023

Research Experience
======
* National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, China	Spring 2020 – Spring 2021
  * Participant, Professor Qiuxiao Chen’s group
  * Developed a resilience-oriented index to assess the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities. Applied AHP-CRITIC and matter-element analysis      methods to calculate index weights. Conducted empirical research in Hangzhou, China.
Department of Regional and Urban Planning, Zhejiang University	Summer 2022
Independent study, Professor Guoqiang Shen’s group	
	Became the first group to apply the Nobel Prize-winning Gale-Shapley algorithm to investigate the spatial matching of urban healthcare facilities and population.
	Compared the performance of the Gale-Shapley approach and the traditional accessibility approach. Demonstrated that the Gale-Shapley approach is superior in consideration of human preferences.
Department of Regional and Urban Planning, Zhejiang University	Winter 2022 – Summer 2023
Independent study, Professor Guoqiang Shen’s group	
	Developed a stable spatial matching method based on the Nobel Prize-winning two-sided matching to address the issue of population bypass the closest low-level facilities in favor of higher-level ones.
	Constructed a utility function from key factors such as facility location, level, price, and the trade-offs of human preferences. Summarized the regularities in the model behavior.
	Designed heterogeneous utility function weights of human preferences because no empirical data could be found for regression. Analyzed different matching scenarios and found those fixed pairs.
Department of Regional and Urban Planning, Zhejiang University	Winter 2023 – April 2025
Independent study, Professor Guoqiang Shen’s group	
	Regressed the parameters of the population’s utility function using the micro-social-economic data of Chinese residents from the CHARLS dataset.
	Developed methodologies using operations research for top-down systemic planning and game-theoretic equilibrium for bottom-up individual choice.
	Revealed significant findings for urban planning, including the reasons behind patients bypassing the closest low-level facilities, the consistency of the trade-offs across various matching approaches and the comparative advantages of systemic planning and individual choice.
School of Geographical Sciences, East China Normal University	Spring 2024 – Feburary 2025
Participant, Professor Yu Zhou and Prof. Guoqiang Shen’s group	
	Assisted in validating a well-known statistical pattern using a global disaster dataset and described the performance across the scales of time and space.
	Explained the cause of the pattern based on the nature of disasters as their stochastic processes and memoryless properties. Designated indexes to conduct absolute and relative risk analysis.
